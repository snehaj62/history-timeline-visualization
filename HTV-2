This era witnessed the rise and fall of numerous dynasties, the spread of Islam, significant architectural and artistic achievements, and the consolidation of regional kingdoms.<br/>Beginning around the 8th century CE, the medieval period saw the emergence of powerful regional kingdoms such as the Cholas in South India, the Chalukyas in the Deccan, and the Palas in Bengal. These kingdoms often engaged in territorial expansion, trade, and cultural exchanges, contributing to the flourishing of art, literature, and architecture.<br/>The medieval era also witnessed the spread of Islam into the Indian subcontinent, beginning with the arrival of Arab traders and later through military conquests by Islamic rulers. The Delhi Sultanate, established in the 13th century by Turkish invaders, marked the consolidation of Muslim rule in North India. This period saw the construction of magnificent mosques, forts, and tombs, blending Persian, Central Asian, and Indian architectural styles.<br/>One of the most significant developments of the medieval period was the establishment of the Mughal Empire in the early 16th century by Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan. The Mughals, with their capital at Delhi, ruled over a vast empire that encompassed much of the Indian subcontinent. Under Akbar the Great, the Mughal Empire reached its zenith, fostering cultural and religious tolerance, administrative reforms, and artistic patronage.<br/>The medieval period also witnessed the arrival of European powers, particularly the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British, who sought to establish trade monopolies and colonial dominion over Indian territories. The struggle for dominance among these European powers, along with the decline of the Mughal Empire, paved the way for British colonial rule in India by the 18th century.Throughout the medieval period, Indian society continued to evolve, with the synthesis of Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic traditions, the emergence of new regional languages and literary forms, and the development of diverse artistic and architectural styles.

Its collapse fractured Indian politics. Over this thousand-year span, competing dynasties sought to expand their power over India. In the second half of this millennia, Muslims from the west swept across India, bringing about the decline of Buddhism and the rise of Islam and Hinduism. These two religions are, today, the largest on the Indian subcontinent. In the 1500s, the Mughal Empire conquered most of India, only to be defeated by the British Empire.<br/> kingdoms and dynasties competed for power in medieval India. While some Buddhist kingdoms existed, most kings followed the religion of Hinduism, weakening the power of Buddhism. While these kings sponsored art, architecture, and religion, they also waged bloody warfare. For centuries these Hindu kingdoms waged war and attempted to secure control of the whole continent, but were unable to. Meanwhile, the Chola Dynasty in the far south would expand out of India by boat, conquering distant islands. This balance of power changed with the invasion of Muslims from the northwest, who swept across India. The first of the large Muslim polities in India was the Delhi Sultanate, which would last centuries. The Muslims in the north were challenged by the Hindu kingdoms to the south, the largest of whom would soon be the Vijayanagara Dynasty.
